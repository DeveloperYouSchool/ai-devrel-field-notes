*Hans wants everyone to know we use AI to help us, not to crank out junk.*  

Youâ€™re looking at a curriculum thatâ€™s been co-developed with AIâ€”on purpose, with intention, and with guardrails.  

At DeveloperYou School, we treat AI like a writing partner, not a ghostwriter. Every lesson you see, every worksheet, every activityâ€”has been brainstormed, challenged, and polished in conversation with an AI assistant. But make no mistake: the ideas, the philosophy, the pacing, the tone... thatâ€™s human.

Why use AI?  
Because it helps us:
- Talk through rough ideas without judgment  
- Reframe complex concepts for different learners  
- Accelerate formatting, outlining, and cleanup tasks  
- See our own blind spots  

This isnâ€™t a gimmick. Itâ€™s how we can create and maintain high-quality, adaptive, learner-centered contentâ€”without a staff of ten.

But we also believe **AI doesnâ€™t replace good thinking**. Thatâ€™s why we constantly audit our work, rewrite for clarity, and cross-check for fit.

So yes, AI is our editor. But weâ€™re the ones holding the pen.
