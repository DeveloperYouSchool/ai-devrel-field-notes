## 🔍 Why This Repo?

AI tools are changing how DevRel teams work—faster content, stronger feedback loops, and new ways to connect with developers. This repo shows what happens when an educator explores that space in public, with transparency and a clipboard-wielding mascot.

Whether you're new to DevRel or experimenting with AI in your workflow, we hope this gives you something useful—or at least entertaining.
